## Learning Outcomes
By building **LogicCalc**, I:  
- Practiced **DOM manipulation** and **event handling** in JavaScript  
- Implemented **number system conversions** across multiple bases  
- Learned to **merge a calculator with a converter** into one app  
- Enhanced **UI/UX skills** with CSS design principles  

---

## Future Improvements
- Add **scientific calculator functions** (sin, cos, tan, log, etc.)  
- Enable **custom base conversions** (Base-3, Base-12, etc.)  
- Add a **copy-to-clipboard** feature for outputs  
- Implement a **dark/light theme toggle**
